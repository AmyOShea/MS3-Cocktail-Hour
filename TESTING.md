## Bugs and Fixes
### 1. Card Overlaying

![card overlay bug](assets/images/README/bugs/bug-01.PNG)

When initially putting together the card layout, I was having an isse where the reicpe card was layering on top of the previous one rather than generating it's own card

After a bit of experimenting, I moved the entire card div into the for loop and managed to sort this issue.
