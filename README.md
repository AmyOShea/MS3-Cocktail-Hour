## Design
### Overall Feel

For this poroject I wanted to have a dark feel to emulate a night-time setting. While there are some family-friendly recipes to choose from, the majority of the content will be more adult-themed so I feel that the bar-type setting was the way to go. 
In keeping with the bar theme, I dewcided to have a neon effect following throughout all pages. 

### Colour Scheme

Because the overall theme is dark, I wanted to go with accent colours that would pop in comparison. I found the perfect colour scheme that would work with my idea, just with a couple of changes for contrast reasons.  

### Typography

There were two fonts that I was interested in for the site. 

[Neon Tubes](https://befonts.com/neon-tubes-neon-light-font-free.html) by [guxjohn](https://befonts.com/author/guxjohn) fit perfectly with the neon light theme but is something to be used sparingly - I want to keep this just just headings and accents. I think too much of this would become tacky very quickly. 

[Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?preview.text_type=custom&preview.text=Collections&query=Raleway) is the chosen font for the majority of the text. In comparrison to Noeon Tubes, it is quite simple ansd offers a contrasting elegance.
